# Wordle Game
The purpose of this project is to learn the Django framework. I am intentionally picking a simple but non-trivial problem statement which is different from the app that is built in the Django tutorial to make sure I understand how the system works and I am not just copy-pasting code.

This is a web-based implementation of the classic word-guessing game, Wordle, built using Django. In this game, the user is presented with a randomly generated five-letter word, and have six attempts to correctly guess the word by entering five-letter words.
